Direction:
> Dataset of example sentences and emotion
> vectorize sentences > Word2Vec
	> averaging method?
> train model > classic prediciton model > split dataset training, accuracy
> figure out how to port chatlogs into Word2Vec

Future Ideas:
> Misspellings
> improve model with BERT (better vectorization)
> Negative/Cancel Out Sentiment
